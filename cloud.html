            <h2> Cloud and Quantum Computing</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="textss">Cloud computing is on-demand access, via the internet, to computing resources—applications,
                servers (physical servers and virtual servers), data storage, development tools, networking
                capabilities, and more—hosted at a remote data center managed by a cloud services provider
                (or CSP). The CSP makes these resources available for a monthly subscription fee or bills them
                according to usage.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="textss">Compared to traditional on-premises IT, and depending on the cloud services you select, cloud
                computing helps do the following:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lower IT costs: </strong>lets you offload some or most of the costs and effort of
                    purchasing, installing, configuring, and managing your own on-premises infrastructure.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Improve agility and time-to-value: </strong>With the cloud, your organization can start using
                    enterprise applications in minutes, instead of waiting weeks or months for IT to respond
                    to a request, purchase and configure supporting hardware, and install the software.
                    Cloud also lets you empower certain users—specifically developers and data
                    scientists—to help themselves to software and support infrastructure.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Scale more easily and cost-effectively: </strong>Cloud provides elasticity—instead of purchasing
                    excess capacity that sits unused during slow periods, you can scale capacity up and
                    down in response to spikes and dips in traffic. You can also take advantage of your cloud
                    provider’s global network to spread your applications closer to users around the world.</li><br>
            </ul>
            <h2>Cloud computing services</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="textss">IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service), PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) and SaaS (Software-as-a-
                Service) are the three most common models of cloud services, and it’s not uncommon for an
                organization to use all three.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)</h3>
            <p class="textss">SaaS—also known as cloud-based software or cloud applications—is application software that’s
                hosted in the cloud, and that users access via a web browser, a dedicated desktop client, or an
                API that integrates with a desktop or mobile operating system. In most cases, SaaS users pay a
                monthly or annual subscription fee; some may offer ‘pay-as-you-go’ pricing based on your
                actual usage.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="textss">In addition to the cost savings, time-to-value, and scalability benefits of cloud, SaaS offers the
                following:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong> Automatic upgrades:</strong> With SaaS, users take advantage of new features as soon as the
                    provider adds them, without having to orchestrate an on-premises upgrade.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Protection from data loss:</strong> Because SaaS stores application data in the cloud with the
                    application, users don’t lose data if their device crashes or breaks.</li><br>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)</h3>
            <p class="textss">PaaS provides software developers with on-demand platform—hardware, complete software
                stack, infrastructure, and even development tools—for running, developing, and managing
                applications without the cost, complexity, and inflexibility of maintaining that platform on-
                premises.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service)</h3>
            <p class="textss">IaaS provides on-demand access to fundamental computing resources—physical and virtual
                servers, networking, and storage—over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis. IaaS enables end
                users to scale and shrink resources on an as-needed basis, reducing the need for high, up-front
                capital expenditures or unnecessary on-premises or ‘owned’ infrastructure and for overbuying
                resources to accommodate periodic spikes in usage.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Types of cloud computing</h2>
            <h3>Public Cloud</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="textss">Public cloud is a type of cloud computing in which a cloud service provider makes computing
                resources—anything from SaaS applications, to individual virtual machines (VMs), to bare metal
                computing hardware, to complete enterprise-grade infrastructures and development
                platforms—available to users over the public internet. These resources might be accessible for
                free, or access might be sold according to subscription-based or pay-per-usage pricing models.</p>
                <br>
            <h3>Private cloud</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="textss">Private cloud is a cloud environment in which all cloud infrastructure and computing resources
                are dedicated to, and accessible by, one customer only. Private cloud combines many of the
                benefits of cloud computing—including elasticity, scalability, and ease of service delivery—with
                the access control, security, and resource customization of on-premises infrastructure.</p>    
            <br>
            <h3>Hybrid cloud</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="textss">Hybrid cloud is just what it sounds like—a combination of public and private cloud
                environments. Specifically, and ideally, a hybrid cloud connects an organization&#39;s private cloud
                services and public clouds into a single, flexible infrastructure for running the organization’s
                applications and workloads.</p>    
            <br>
            <h3>Multicloud and hybrid multicloud</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="textss">Multicloud is the use of two or more clouds from two or more different cloud providers. Having
                a multicloud environment can be as simple using email SaaS from one vendor and image editing
                SaaS from another. But when enterprises talk about multicloud, they&#39;re typically talking about
                using multiple cloud services—including SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS services—from two or more of the
                leading public cloud providers.</p>    
            <br>
            <h2>Cloud security</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="textss">Traditionally, security concerns have been the primary obstacle for organizations
                considering cloud services, particularly public cloud services. In response to demand, however,
                the security offered by cloud service providers is steadily outstripping on-premises security
                solutions.</p><br>
            <p class="textss">Maintaining cloud security demands different procedures and employee skillsets than in legacy
                IT environments. Some cloud security best practices include the following:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong> Shared responsibility for security:</strong> Generally, the cloud provider is responsible for
                    securing cloud infrastructure and the customer is responsible for protecting its data
                    within the cloud—but it&#39;s also important to clearly define data ownership between
                    private and public third parties.</li><br>
                <li><strong> Data encryption:</strong> Data should be encrypted while at rest, in transit, and in use.
                    Customers need to maintain full control over security keys and hardware security
                    module.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>User identity and access management:</strong>  Customer and IT teams need full understanding
                    of and visibility into network, device, application, and data access.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Collaborative management:</strong> Proper communication and clear, understandable
                    processes between IT, operations, and security teams will ensure seamless cloud
                    integrations that are secure and sustainable.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Security and compliance monitoring:</strong> This begins with understanding all regulatory
                    compliance standards applicable to your industry and setting up active monitoring of all
                    connected systems and cloud-based services to maintain visibility of all data exchanges
                    between public, private, and hybrid cloud environments.</li>
                <br>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h2>What is quantum computing?</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="textss">Quantum computing is a rapidly-emerging technology that harnesses the laws of
                quantum mechanics to solve problems too complex for classical computers.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="textss">Today, IBM Quantum makes real quantum hardware -- a tool scientists only began to imagine
                three decades ago -- available to hundreds of thousands of developers. Our engineers deliver
                ever-more-powerful superconducting quantum processors at regular intervals, alongside crucial
                advances in software and quantum-classical orchestration. This work drives toward the
                quantum computing speed and capacity necessary to change the world.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>How do quantum computers work?</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="textss">Quantum computers are elegant machines, smaller and requiring less energy than
                supercomputers. An IBM Quantum processor is a wafer not much bigger than the one found in
                a laptop. And a quantum hardware system is about the size of a car, made up mostly of cooling
                systems to keep the superconducting processor at its ultra-cold operational temperature.</p>
