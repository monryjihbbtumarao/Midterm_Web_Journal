            <h2> What is Nano Technology?</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="textss">Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter on a near-atomic scale to produce new structures, materials and devices. The technology promises scientific advancement in many sectors such as medicine, consumer products, energy, materials and manufacturing.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Origins</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="textss">The concepts that seeded nanotechnology were first discussed in 1959 by renowned physicist Richard Feynman in his talk There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom, in which he described the possibility of synthesis via direct manipulation of atoms.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="textss">The term "nano-technology" was first used by Norio Taniguchi in 1974, though it was not widely known. Inspired by Feynman's concepts, K. Eric Drexler used the term "nanotechnology" in his 1986 book Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology, which proposed the idea of a nanoscale "assembler" which would be able to build a copy of itself and of other items of arbitrary complexity with atomic control. Also in 1986, Drexler co-founded The Foresight Institute (with which he is no longer affiliated) to help increase public awareness and understanding of nanotechnology concepts and implications.</p>
            <h2>Fundamental concepts</h2>
            <p class="textss">Nanotechnology is the engineering of functional systems at the molecular scale. This covers both current work and concepts that are more advanced. In its original sense, nanotechnology refers to the projected ability to construct items from the bottom up, using techniques and tools being developed today to make complete, high-performance products.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Current research</h2>
            <h3>Nanomaterials</h3>
            <p class="textss">The nanomaterials field includes subfields which develop or study materials having unique properties arising from their nanoscale dimensions.</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Interface and colloid science has given rise to many materials which may be useful in nanotechnology, such as carbon nanotubes and other fullerenes, and various nanoparticles and nanorods. Nanomaterials with fast ion transport are related also to nanoionics and nanoelectronics.</li><br>
                <li>Nanoscale materials can also be used for bulk applications; most present commercial applications of nanotechnology are of this flavor.</li><br>
                <li>Progress has been made in using these materials for medical applications; see Nanomedicine.     </li><br>
                <li>Nanoscale materials such as nanopillars are sometimes used in solar cells which combats the cost of traditional silicon solar cells.</li><br>
                <li>Development of applications incorporating semiconductor nanoparticles to be used in the next generation of products, such as display technology, lighting, solar cells and biological imaging; see quantum dots.</li><br>
                <li>Recent application of nanomaterials include a range of biomedical applications, such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, antibacterials and biosensors.</li><br>
            </ul>
            <h2>Bottom-up approaches</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="textss">These seek to arrange smaller components into more complex assemblies.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>DNA nanotechnology utilizes the specificity of Watson–Crick basepairing to construct well-defined structures out of DNA and other nucleic acids.</li><br>
                <li>Approaches from the field of "classical" chemical synthesis (Inorganic and organic synthesis) also aim at designing molecules with well-defined shape</li><br>
                <li>More generally, molecular self-assembly seeks to use concepts of supramolecular chemistry, and molecular recognition in particular, to cause single-molecule components to automatically arrange themselves into some useful conformation.</li><br>
                <li>Atomic force microscope tips can be used as a nanoscale "write head" to deposit a chemical upon a surface in a desired pattern in a process called dip pen nanolithography. This technique fits into the larger subfield of nanolithography.</li><br>
                <li>Molecular Beam Epitaxy allows for bottom up assemblies of materials, most notably semiconductor materials commonly used in chip and computing applications, stacks, gating, and nanowire lasers.</li><br>
            </ul>
            <h2>Top-down approaches</h2>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Many technologies that descended from conventional solid-state silicon methods for fabricating microprocessors are now capable of creating features smaller than 100 nm, falling under the definition of nanotechnology.</li><br>
                <li>Solid-state techniques can also be used to create devices known as nanoelectromechanical systems or NEMS, which are related to microelectromechanical systems or MEMS.</li><br>
                <li>Focused ion beams can directly remove material, or even deposit material when suitable precursor gasses are applied at the same time. For example, this technique is used routinely to create sub-100 nm sections of material for analysis in Transmission electron microscopy.</li><br>
                <li>Atomic force microscope tips can be used as a nanoscale "write head" to deposit a resist, which is then followed by an etching process to remove material in a top-down method.</li><br>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h2>Functional approaches</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="textss">These seek to develop components of a desired functionality without regard to how they might be assembled.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Magnetic assembly for the synthesis of anisotropic superparamagnetic materials such as recently presented magnetic nano chains.</li><br>
                <li>Molecular scale electronics seeks to develop molecules with useful electronic properties. These could then be used as single-molecule components in a nanoelectronic device</li><br>
                <li>Synthetic chemical methods can also be used to create synthetic molecular motors, such as in a so-called nanocar.</li><br>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h2>TBiomimetic approaches</h2>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Bionics or biomimicry seeks to apply biological methods and systems found in nature, to the study and design of engineering systems and modern technology. Biomineralization is one example of the systems studied.</li><br>
                <li>Bionics or biomimicry seeks to apply biological methods and systems found in nature, to the study and design of engineering systems and modern technology. Biomineralization is one example of the systems studied.</li><br>
            </ul>
            <h2>Speculative</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="textss">These subfields seek to anticipate what inventions nanotechnology might yield, or attempt to propose an agenda along which inquiry might progress. These often take a big-picture view of nanotechnology, with more emphasis on its societal implications than the details of how such inventions could actually be created.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Molecular nanotechnology is a proposed approach which involves manipulating single molecules in finely controlled, deterministic ways. This is more theoretical than the other subfields, and many of its proposed techniques are beyond current capabilities.</li><br>
                <li>Nanorobotics centers on self-sufficient machines of some functionality operating at the nanoscale. There are hopes for applying nanorobots in medicine.</li><br>
                <li>Productive nanosystems are "systems of nanosystems" which will be complex nanosystems that produce atomically precise parts for other nanosystems, not necessarily using novel nanoscale-emergent properties, but well-understood fundamentals of manufacturing. </li><br>
                <li>Programmable matter seeks to design materials whose properties can be easily, reversibly and externally controlled though a fusion of information science and materials science.</li><br>
                <li>Due to the popularity and media exposure of the term nanotechnology, the words picotechnology and femtotechnology have been coined in analogy to it, although these are only used rarely and informally.</li><br>
            </ul>
