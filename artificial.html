            <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>
            <p class="textss">Artificial Intelligence is composed of two words Artificial and Intelligence.
                Artificial defines "man-made," and intelligence defines "thinking power", or “the ability to learn
                and solve problems” hence Artificial Intelligence means "a man-made thinking power."
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="textss">Intelligence, as we know, is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge. Knowledge is the
                information acquired through experience. Experience is the knowledge gained through exposure (training).
                Summing the terms up, we get artificial intelligence as the “copy of something natural (i.e., human
                beings)‘WHO’ is capable of acquiring and applying the information it has gained
                through exposure.”
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="textss">Artificial Intelligence exists when a machine can have human-based skills such as learning,
                reasoning, and solving problems with Artificial Intelligence you do not need to preprogram a machine to
                do some work, despite that you can create a machine with programmed algorithms which can work with
                own intelligence.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Need for Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <div>
                <ol>
                    <li>To create expert systems that exhibit intelligent behavior with the capability to learn,
                        demonstrate, explain and advice its users.</li>
                    <li>Helping machines find solutions to complex problems like humans do and applying them as
                        algorithms in a computer-friendly manner.</li>

                </ol>
            </div>
            <h2>Goals of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="textss">Following are the main goals of Artificial Intelligence:</p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Replicate human intelligence</li>
                <li>Solve Knowledge-intensive tasks</li>
                <li>An intelligent connection of perception and action</li>
                <li>Building a machine which can perform tasks that requires human intelligence such as:<ul>
                    <li>Proving a theorem</li>
                    <li>Playing chess</li>
                    <li>Plan some surgical operation</li>
                    <li>Driving a car in traffic</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>Creating some system which can exhibit intelligent behavior, learn new things by itself,
                    demonstrate, explain, and can advise to its user.</li>

            <h2>What Comprises to Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="textss">Following are some main advantages of Artificial Intelligence:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>High Accuracy with fewer errors: AI machines or systems are prone to fewer errors and high
                    accuracy as it takes decisions as per pre-experience or information.</li>
                <li>High-Speed: AI systems can be of very high-speed and fast-decision making, because of that
                    AI systems can beat a chess champion in the Chess game.</li>
                <li>High reliability: AI machines are highly reliable and can perform the same action multiple times
                    with high accuracy.</li>
                <li>Useful for risky areas: AI machines can be helpful in situations such as defusing a bomb,
                    exploring the ocean floor, where to employ a human can be risky.</li>
                <li>Digital Assistant: AI can be very useful to provide digital assistant to users such as AI
                    technology is currently used by various E-commerce websites to show the products as per customer
                    requirements.</li>
                <li>Useful as a public utility: AI can be very useful for public utilities such as a self-driving car
                    which can make our journey safer and hassle-free, facial recognition for security purposes, Natural language</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h2>BIG DATA</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="textss">Big data refers to huge amounts of data. Big data requires innovative forms of information
                processing to draw insights, automate processes, and help decision making. Big data can be structured data
                
                that corresponds to a formal pattern, such as traditional data sets and databases.Also, big data includes semi-
                structured and unstructured formats, such as word-processing documents, videos, images, audio,
                
                presentations, social media interactions, streams, web pages, and many other kinds of content. Figure 3.6
                depicts the rapid change of the data landscape.</p>
