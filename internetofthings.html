            <h2>What is IoT?</h2>
            <p class="textss">The description of the Internet of Things is related to different definitions used by several groups
                for promoting the particular concept in the whole world.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="textss">Generally, The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects or "things" embedded
                with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables these objects to collect and
                exchange data. IoT is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects,
                animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network
                without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. IoT is a network of devices that can
                sense, accumulate and transfer data over the internet without any human intervention.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="textss">IoT utilizes existing and emerging technology for sensing, networking, and robotics. IoT exploits
                recent advances in software, falling hardware prices, and modern attitudes towards technology. Its new and
                advanced elements bring major changes in the delivery of products, goods, and services; and the social,
                economic, and political impact of those changes.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>History of IoT</h2>
            <p class="textss">The Internet of Things has not been around for very long. However, there have been visions of
                machines communicating with one another since the early 1800s. Machines have been providing direct
                communications since the telegraph (the first landline) was developed in the 1830s and 1840s. Described
                as “wireless telegraphy,” the first radio voice transmission took place on June 3, 1900, providing another
                necessary component for developing the Internet of Things. The development of computers began in the
                1950s.
            </p>
            <h2>IoT − Advantages</h2><br>
            <br>
            <p class="textss">The advantages of IoT span across every area of lifestyle and business. Here is a list of some of the
                advantages that IoT has to offer:</p><br>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Technology Optimization − The same technologies and data which improve the customer
                    experience also improve device use, and aid in more potent improvements to technology. IoT unlocks a
                    world of critical functional and field data.</li><br>
                <li>Reduced Waste − IoT makes areas of improvement clear. Current analytics give us superficial
                    insight, but IoT provides real-world information leading to the more effective management of resources.</li><br>
                <li>An intelligent connection of perception and action</li><br>
                <li>Enhanced Data Collection − Modern data collection suffers from its limitations and its design
                    for passive use. IoT breaks it out of those spaces and places it exactly where humans really want to go to
                    analyze our world. It allows an accurate picture of everything.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>IoT – Disadvantages</h2>
            <p class="textss">Here is a list of some of the disadvantages of IoT. these are:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>As the number of connected devices increases and more information is shared between devices,
                    the potential that a hacker could steal confidential information also increases.</li><br>
                <li>If there’s a bug in the system, it’s likely that every connected device will become corrupted.</li><br>
                <li>Since there’s no international standard of compatibility for IoT, it’s difficult for devices from
                    different manufacturers to communicate with each other.</li><br>
                <li>Enterprises may eventually have to deal with massive numbers maybe even millions of IoT
                    devices and collecting and managing the data from all those devices will be challenging.</li><br>

            <h2>Applications of IoT</h2>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Agriculture - For indoor planting, IoT makes monitoring and management of micro-
                    climate conditions a reality, which in turn increases production. For outside planting, devices using IoT
                    
                    technology can sense soil moisture and nutrients, in conjunction with weather data, better control smart
                    irrigation and fertilizer systems. If the sprinkler systems dispense water only when needed, for example,
                    this prevents wasting a precious resource.</li><br>
                <li>Consumer Use - For private citizens, IoT devices in the form of wearables and smart
                    homes make life easier. Wearables cover accessories such as Fitbit, smartphones, Apple watches, health
                    monitors, to name a few. These devices improve entertainment, network connectivity, health, and fitness.
                    Smart homes take care of things like activating environmental controls so that your house is at peak comfort
                    when you come home. Dinner that requires either an oven or a crockpot can be started remotely, so the food
                    is ready when you arrive. Security is made more accessible as well, with the consumer having the ability to
                    control appliances and lights remotely, as well as activating a smart lock to allow the appropriate people to
                    enter the house even if they don’t have a key.</li><br>
                <li>Healthcare - First and foremost, wearable IoT devices let hospitals monitor their
                    patients’ health at home, thereby reducing hospital stays while still providing up to the minute real-time
                    information that could save lives. In hospitals, smart beds keep the staff informed as to the availability,
                    thereby cutting wait time for free space. Putting IoT sensors on critical equipment means fewer breakdowns
                    and increased reliability, which can mean the difference between life and death. Elderly care becomes
                    significantly more comfortable with IoT. In addition to the above-mentioned real-time home monitoring,
                    sensors can also determine if a patient has fallen or is suffering a heart attack.</li>
                <li>• Insurance - Even the insurance industry can benefit from the IoT revolution. Insurance
                    companies can offer their policyholders discounts for IoT wearables such as Fitbit. By employing fitness
                    tracking, the insurer can offer customized policies and encourage healthier habits, which in the long run
                    benefits everyone, insurer, and customer alike.</li><br>
                <li>• Retail - IoT technology has a lot to offer the world of retail. Online and in-store shopping
                    sales figures can control warehouse automation and robotics, information gleaned from IoT sensors. Much
                    of this relies on RFIDs, which are already in heavy use worldwide. Mall locations are iffy things; business
                    tends to fluctuate, and the advent of online shopping has driven down the demand for brick and mortar
                    establishments. However, IoT can help analyze mall traffic so that stores located in malls can make the
                    necessary adjustments that enhance the customer’s shopping experience while reducing overhead. Speaking
                    of customer engagement, IoT helps retailers target customers based on past purchases. Equipped with the
                    information provided through IoT, a retailer could craft a personalized promotion for their loyal customers,
                    thereby eliminating the need for costly massmarketing promotions that don’t stand as much of a chance
                    of success. Much of these promotions can be conducted through the customers’ smartphones, especially if
                    they have an app for the appropriate store.</li><br>
                <li>Transportation - By this time, most people have heard about the progress being made
                    with self-driving cars. But that’s just one bit of the vast potential in the field of transportation. The GPS,
                    which if you think of it is another example of IoT, is being utilized to help transportation companies plot
                    faster and more efficient routes for trucks hauling freight, thereby speeding up delivery times. There’s
                    already significant progress made in navigation, once again alluding to a phone or car’s GPS. But city
                    planners can also use that data to help determine traffic patterns, parking space demand, and road
                    construction and maintenance.</li><br>
                <li>Utilities - IoT sensors can be employed to monitor environmental conditions such as
                    humidity, temperature, and lighting. The information provided by IoT sensors can aid in the creation of
                    algorithms that regulate energy usage and make the appropriate adjustments, eliminating the human
                    equation (and let’s face it, who of us hasn’t forgotten to switch off lights in a room or turn down the
                    thermostat?). With IoT-driven environmental control, businesses and private residences can experience
                    significant energy savings, which in the long run, benefits everyone, including the environment! On a larger
                    scale, data gathered by the Internet of Things can be used to help run municipal power grids more
                    efficiently, analyzing factors such as usage. In addition, the sensors can help pinpoint outages faster, thereby
                    increasing the response time of repair crews and decreasing blackout times.</li><br>
